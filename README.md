psych fork meant for my personal use

it removes:
- base game files
- lua scripting
- hscript scripting (hopefully)
- modpack support
- language support

I'm more of a hardcoding person soooo this is hardcoding oriented psych fork
# THIS ISNT AN ENGINE AND I WILL NEVER CLASSIFY IT AS SUCH ITS A FORK

I don't recommend using this one for your own mods. Instead I highly encourage you to look for something better and more stable, such as: 
- [Base Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine)
- [Codename Engine](https://github.com/CodenameCrew/CodenameEngine)
- [FPS Plus](https://github.com/ThatRozebudDude/FPS-Plus-Public/)
- [Doido Engine](https://github.com/DoidoTeam/FNF-Doido-Engine)
- etc.
